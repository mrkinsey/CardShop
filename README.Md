# Card Shop Inventory Management Systems

The Card Shop MVC is where users can create, read, update, delete (C.R.U.D.) categories, card sets, and card singles. When card sets or card singles are created, users have the availability to update the numbers of purchased and sold along with the sale and purchase price to calculate the valuation of the inventory along with the profit or loss of sold items.

This assignment was created for Eleven Fifty Academy's Red Badge, calling for students to build a .NET Web Application using n-tier architecture.
